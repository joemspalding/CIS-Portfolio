In this program, we have further iterated on the Library Book program by including introductory SOLID principles, such as Separation of Concern (SoC). We have included a Library class which manages a list of all LibraryItems and LibraryPatrons. Also in this program we attempt to separate front end concerns through creating forms which manage the separate actions of the Library.
